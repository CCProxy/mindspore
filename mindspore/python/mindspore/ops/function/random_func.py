def random_gamma(shape, alpha, seed=0, seed2=0):
    r"""
    Outputs random values from the Gamma distribution(s) described by alpha.


    Args:
        shape (Tensor): The shape of random tensor to be generated.
            Must be one of the following types: int32, int64. 1-D integer tensor.
        alpha (Tensor): The alpha Î± distribution parameter.
            A Tensor. Must be one of the following types: half, float32, float64.
        seed (int): Seed is used as entropy source for the random number engines to generate
            pseudo-random numbers, must be non-negative. Default: None, which will be treated as 0.

    Returns:
        Tensor. The shape should be equal to the concat shape between the input `shape` and the broadcast
        of `alpha`.
        The dtype is the same type as alpha.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If `shape` is not a Tensor.
        TypeError: If `alpha` is not a Tensor.
